# **Some Algorithms**
This repo is about **algorithms** and **solutions** that I made. You can examine my solutions to these algorithms that I come across.

## 1) **EvenPair:** 
Program that returns True if 2 numbers are even in consecutive numbers in the given string expression.
### **Examples**: 
- "hy361jpa68" -> True, because 6 and 8 is even.
- "75khs34qas98wlk" -> False.
- "411sd95sl436kdg5fh4" -> True,  because 4 and 6 is even in 436.
